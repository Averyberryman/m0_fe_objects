# Self-Evaluation

- WThis final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?

- I felt more and more prepared with less and less instruction. I noticed throughout the modules that where meticulous explanations used to exist, they started to assume (rightly) that we should know certain principles already, and that helped me build my fluency.

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?

- it was rough at first, but now it's going really well.

- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?

- Google is a great resource, and the worst thing that can happen is that we throw up an error or something like that in the console. I also really liked collaborating on this one; it helps reinforce what we know already!
